A quick exercise to create a single view of a property website, done while learning React at a coding bootcamp.
The point was to re-use components with different data passed in as React props, so a card advertising a house could be repeated to advertise several houses. Or just two houses, in my case. It’s pretty basic.

I did have a screenshot showing what I was trying to emulate, but I no longer have it. Sorry!

Here’s a screenshot of my rendition, as viewed in Opera:
